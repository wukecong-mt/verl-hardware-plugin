## Introduction

This document describes how to use verl for reinforcement learning training on
Moore Threads MUSA accelerators.

## MUSA Migration Patches

MUSA deployments may use two separate compatibility layers:

- MUSA support for the upstream Megatron/MCore implementation is provided by
  the external `megatron-lm-musa-patch` compatibility layer. The patch is loaded
  at runtime from the directory specified by `MUSA_PATCH_PATH` (usually
  `/home/megatron-lm-musa-patch` in the release image); it adapts the
  unmodified Megatron code for MUSA execution.

- MUSA compatibility for VERL and SGLang runtime components is provided by the
  deployment-specific `verl-musa-patch` compatibility layer. The patch is loaded
  at runtime from the directory specified by `VERL_MUSA_PATCH` (usually
  `/home/verl-musa-patch` in the release image) and made available to Ray workers
  through `PYTHONPATH`; it adapts the VERL and SGLang runtime components for MUSA
  execution.
